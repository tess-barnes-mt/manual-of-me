## Contact me for mentoring in

- awkward conversations

## Give me feedback on
I love getting data to help me grow and focus on the right things to help folks. Gimme all the data! Slack, Bob, email all good. 

I'm happy with face to face but I will be listening and taking your gift away rather than discussing it on the hoof.

## Tea or Coffee?
Coffee in the mornings. Fresh ground is best.

Tea in the afternoons. Taking time for a cuppa is a good way to reset part way through the day.
